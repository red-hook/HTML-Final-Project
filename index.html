            <p>I've divided them up into 
            <a href="#hardwoods"><strong>hardwood</strong></a> (aka <em>deciduous</em>) species
            and 
            <a href="#softwoods"><strong>softwood</strong></a> (aka <em>coniferous</em>) species.</p>

                <p>These are <em>deciduous trees</em>, meaning they drop their leaves every Fall and grow new ones in the Spring.</p>

                            <li>The sap can be boiled to make maple syrup, but it has a lower sugar content than other types, so it's not used commercially.</li>
                            <li>The branches are long and brittle, which means I have a mess to clean up after storms.</li>

                                <li>Hemlock is used for railroad ties because the wood is especially good at holding spikes.</li>
                                <li>The bark was an important source of tannins for the leather tanning industry.</li>
